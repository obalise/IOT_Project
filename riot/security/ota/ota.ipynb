    "## SUIT Firmware update\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we propose to perform firmware updates on IoT-LAB M3 devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of this exercise is as follows:\n",
    "- An updatable firmware is built and flashed first on the device.\n",
    "- This firmware provides a CoAP server to receive update notifications and is able to download new firmware images from another CoAP server running on an IoT-LAB SSH frontend\n",
    "- On the frontend, the CoAP server exposes the images located in a directory on the server: as a result, publishing new updates is just a matter of putting files in a directory\n",
    "- The update is trigger manually from the device itself with a shell command\n",
    "\n",
    "The application used in this exercise implements a version of the SUIT (Softwate Update for the Internet of Things) protocol that is in the standardization process at IETF.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you saw previously in other networking exercises, to be able to reach the device from the SSH frontend, you'll have to run ethos: this will create a bridge between the serial port of the device and the SSH frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is an updatable firmware?\n",
    "\n",
    "For a firmware to become updatable, several conditions must be met:\n",
    "- The flash memory on the device must be devided in 3 parts:\n",
    "  1. The beginning of the flash is reserved to a small and very simple bootloader application whose goal is to choose and verify the application to boot\n",
    "  2. The rest of the flash is divided into 2 equally sized memory *slots*. Each slot may contain a binary firmware for a given application. At the beginning of each slot are located some metadata which describe the version of the application and the name of the application. Since only one application can run at a time on a microcontroller, only one slot is active at a time.\n",
    " \n",
    "- The firmware in the active slot must contain some logic for retrieving an update. This update is copied on-the-fly to the other slot. Once the update has completed, the application reboots the device. During the boot phase, the bootloader chooses the most recent version between the 2 slots and launches the application on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, initially, **an updatable device must be provisionned with a bootloader and a slot containing an application with the update logic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discover the firmware update mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, we propose you to test the basic firmware update mechanism only between the SSH frontend and the device: the device will be provisioned with an updatable firmware, a bridge between the SSH frontend and the device will be setup using `ethos` and the new firmware will be stored on the SSH frontend and exposed to the device on a CoAP server running on the frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1:** prepare the device"

You can add new endpoints to the application for reading the temperature or pressure from one of the sensors available on the IoT-LAB M3 device and publish an update of your new application (starting from step 3 in the previous section).\n",

    "#### Perform over-the-air updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, in this notebook, firmware updates were only performed over a wired connection between the SSH frontend and the IoT-LAB M3 device. To perform the update over a wireless 802.15.4 radio, you can:\n",
    "- start an experiment with 2 IoT-LAB M3 devices, one will act as a border router between the wired network and a wireless network\n",
    "- setup a border router, see [ipv6](../../networking/ipv6/ipv6.ipynb)\n",
    "- disable `ethos` in each updatable firmwares by adding `ETHOS=0` to the build command line\n",
    "- enable the radio by prepending `USEMODULE=gnrc_netdev_default` to the build command line\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of provisioning command line:\n",
    "```\n",
    "USEMODULE=gnrc_netdev_default ETHOS=0 make IOTLAB_NODE=auto riotboot/flash-combined-slot0\n",
