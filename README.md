## Welcome to the IoT-LAB training resources

### Description

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks available at
https://labs.iot-lab.info and used ad training resources to easily start using
the IoT-LAB testbed.

### Getting started

We recommend that you follow the `start.ipynb` notebook to learn how to use
Jupyter Notebooks.

- Notebooks in **riot** will let you discover the [RIOT](https://riot-os.org)
  operating system:
  - **riot/basics** contains exercises on basics features of RIOT
  - **riot/networking** contains networking exercises (802.15.4, IPv6, UDP, CoAP
    and LwM2M)
  - **riot/lorawan** contains exercises on LoRaWAN LPWAN networks
  - **riot/security** contains exercises on security aspects for IoT (hash,
    crypto, DTLS and OTA)
- Notebooks in **contiki-ng** contains exercises to discover the
  [Contiki-NG](https://www.contiki-ng.org/) operating system
- Notebooks in **testbed** shows advanced features of the IoT-LAB testbed:
  - for measuring power consumption on IoT-LAB M3 devices
  - for sniffing radio paquets between IoT-LAB M3 devices
