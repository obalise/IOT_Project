    "## IPC messages between threads\n",
    "\n",
    "> We recommend that you follow the [threading notebook](../threading/threading.ipynb) before following this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will discover the IPC mechanism available in RIOT to exchange messages between threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will write a shell command that sends a string to a thread using an IPC message. The receiver thread prints each received message. This exercise provides a starting RIOT application with the shell handler already implemented ((see [Makefile](Makefile) and [main.c](main.c)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implement the new thread\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by editing the [main.c](main.c) file and implement the listener thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add the includes for thread and ipc message APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include \"thread.h\"\n",
    "#include \"msg.h\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Declare 2 static variables: the pid of the listener thread and the memory stack that will be used by the thread:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "static kernel_pid_t pid;\n",
    "static char stack[THREAD_STACKSIZE_MAIN];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We can now add the listener thread function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "static void *listener_thread(void *arg)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    (void)arg;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    while (1) {\n",
    "        msg_t msg;\n",
    "        msg_receive(&msg); /* Blocks until a message is received */\n",
    "        printf(\"Message received: %s\\n\", (char *)msg.content.ptr);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    return NULL;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the thread listens endlessly for incoming IPC messages. The call to `msg_receive` is blocking until a message is received and the content of the message is a pointer to the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, we can create the thread in the `main` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "    pid = thread_create(stack, sizeof(stack),\n",
    "                        THREAD_PRIORITY_MAIN - 1,\n",
    "                        0,\n",
    "                        listener_thread,\n",
    "                        NULL, \"listener thread\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `thread_create` function returns the `pid` of the listener thread, we will use this variable later in the send_command function. The new thread has a higher priority than the main thread, so this ensures it's started immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Let's verify that the code is building fine and that the thread is correctly created: open a new terminal with menu `File > New > Terminal` and launch there the following command:"
