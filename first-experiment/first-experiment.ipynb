    "It's time to start working with the IoT-LAB testbed! In this hands-on activity you will launch your first experiment with CLI-tools. For this you will book a node and flash on it a binary firmware provided by us. You will discover how you can directly interact with the node during the experiment with its serial port which is forwarded by a TCP socket on the SSH frontend. In this way you can access the firmware shell and run commands such as reading temperature sensor values. For all the next activities you will repeat these steps of submitting experiment and booking nodes and it's important to understand them well. Of course you will also learn later on how to write your own firmware with an embedded OS and flash it on the nodes.\n",
