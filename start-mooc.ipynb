If you are unfamiliar with this environment or this is the first time you are going to use Jupyter notebooks we strongly encourage you to read this [introduction](./start.ipynb).\n",

    "This activity will allow you to discover the infrastructure of the IoT-LAB testbed and give you information about access, how you can interact with it. This is not a hands-on activity where you will start a testbed experiment, but rather a list of pre-requisites that will be useful for the whole Mooc suite. Be patient, you will be programming an IoT object in the next activities.\n",

In the MOOC activities, you will only use the IoT-LAB M3 board (aka 'm3:at86rf231'). Free resources are the one with the state 'Alive'. They are listed by ids, '-' specifying a range, and '+' a concatenation. The entry \"1-6+8-11\" corresponds with the list of nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11.\n",
